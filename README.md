# Eureka-service
Implementation of Spring Cloud Netflix Eureka Server . 

## Use

This helps microservices to register to a Discovery server(eureka-server) which enables them to locate other registered microservices . \This helps us to eliminate the hard coding of url to the other microservices.

2. Run `mvn clean install`

## How to run

In the project directory, you can run:

### `mvn spring-boot:run`

Runs the app in the development mode.\
Runs on [http://localhost:8761](http://localhost:8761).
